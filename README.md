# PyASN1-PER-Encoder
## A pure Python 3 implementation of the unaligned Packed Encoding Rules (PER) encoding format for ASN.1.  

This code integrates with the PyASN.1 library to provide encoding and decoding services.  The encoder is stand-alone and requires no dependencies other than PyASN.1.

The encoder/decoder currently works with the majority of the ASN.1 types.  The code is fairly modular and additional types can be added easily.  See the comments in the encoder/decoder code to learn more about how they work.
